## Image Segmentation with OpenCV and JavaFX

*Computer Vision course - [Politecnico di Torino](http://www.polito.it)*

A project, made in Eclipse (Neon), for experimenting with edge detection, erosion and dilatation. It performs image segmentation upon a webcam video stream. Some screenshots of the running project are available in the `results` folder.

Please, note that the project is an Eclipse project, made for teaching purposes. Before using it, you need to install the OpenCV library (version 3.x) and JavaFX 8 and create a `User Library` named `opencv` that links to the OpenCV jar and native libraries.

A guide for getting started with OpenCV and Java is available at [http://opencv-java-tutorials.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html](http://opencv-java-tutorials.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html).
